Programming. To the uninitiated eye it may amount to tapping keys on a computer
like a monkey. And sadly, that's what it's been relegated to by many.
Nonetheless, there are a few of us, just like you (I hope) and me, that see it
for what it really is: art.

An empty text file is to a programmer what a blank canvas to a painter. Our
keystrokes are brush strokes. Our paradigms, genres. Code can be aggressive or
chaotic, but it must retain the intrinsic quality that makes it worth writing:
elegance.

Code devoid of elegance is nothing more than the ultimate expression of hatred
from mankind towards all that humanity encompasses. It's the rejection of what
separates us from machines. This is more so today, in the era of AI ðŸ¤®, than
ever. For a machine can actually write code like and emotionless man o woman
would.

This is why it is our job to preseve humanity in our craft throught the
fabrication of software programs that are beautiful and elegant. We must imprint
our state of mind, and the state of hearts, in every line of code we write.

Else, let the machines take us out.
